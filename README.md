# COMP 557 Assignments

## Rasterizer

In this assignment, I implemented a simple rasterizer in Python.
Notable features:
- Barycentric coordinate computation
- Normal interpolation
- Scalable resolution
- Different shading modes
- Z-buffer
  
## Rotation interpolation and Modern GL

I implemented interpolation for various rotation types in this assignment, including Euler angles and quaternions.
We can switch between different viewpoints due to appropriate transformation matrices

## Mesh Subdivision
